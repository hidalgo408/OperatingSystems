Operating system functions
Another operating system function is device management. It keeps track of all devices connected to the system. This also tells the system if it is an input or an output device. 
My final example of an operating system function is file management. This feature allows for directories and navigation through the system. It keeps track of all the information stored and the status of every file in the system.
